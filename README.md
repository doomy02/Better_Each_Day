# Better_Each_Day ![study](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60173965/230712882-8e8a72b5-2655-4b32-b690-5c34435138e8.png)

An application that wants to simulate a thriving community of students that earns and spends tokens via a quest system, and badges and competes to be in the top of the ranking system.

In this project, you can:
  - sign in to your account or sign up for a new account;
  - spend your tokens by putting a bounty on a quest's head;
  - earn tokens by accomplishing a quest;
  - view the global ranking.

At this moment, this application is based around polynomials. So you can perform some mathematical operations on them:
  - add;
  - subtract;
  - multiply;
  - divide.

Technologies used:
  - Java -> implementation; 
  - MySQL -> database;
  - Hibernate -> link between Java & MySQL;
  - Postman -> transition to frontend.
